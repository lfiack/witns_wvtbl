# witns_wvtbl
Wavetable oscillator

## Make the project work
This project uses a submodule for the KiCAD library. To get it properly, use the `--recursive` option when cloning the repo :
```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:lfiack/witns_wvtbl.git
```

The firmware is developped with VSCode and the `stm32-for-vscode` plugin. There is now a plugin developped by ST, but I didn't take time to test it.
